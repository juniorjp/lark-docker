# Contributing to the boilerplate

Please clone this repo, and follow the setup steps to get the project up and running.

If you would like to add a feature, then generally I'll be all for it. But ensure that your feature is as general purpose and universal as possible. This project is intended to be a starter kit, so I want to keep it simple.

Once you think you have completed your work, please submit a pull request from your branch to this repo.
